## Purpose
The purpose of the pH meter is to test a substances level of acidity. pH is an important metric that affects taste, stability, and spoilage. The process of fermenting our foods reduces the pH making it more acidic. Acidic food is associated with sour or tangy flavors and provides an environment less suited to many spoilage organisms.
## Terms/Definitions
**pH:** A figure expressing the acidity or alkalinity of a solution on a logarithmic scale on which 7 is neutral, lower values are more acid and higher values more alkaline.

**Probe:** The portion of the device that is submerged into the substance being measured.

**Buffer Solution:** A buffer solution is a chemical that is designed to maintain a specific pH. Buffer solutions are used to calibrate a pH meter. For a 2 point calibration, typically 4.01 pH and 7.01 pH buffer solutions are used.

## Procedure
### Step 1
Remove probe from the storage solution.

### Step 2
Rinse the probe with distilled water and dab dry with a kimtech wipe.
>Do not aggressively rub the probe with the wipe as the friction could generate static electricity and damage the probe.

### Step 3
Submerge the probe in the substance you wish to test. Stir gently.

### Step 4
Allow the pH meter to equilibrate. The value on the device display will settle. When the value seemingly stops changing, this will be your reading. Record your reading in the appropriate location.

### Step 5
Remove the probe from the test substance and rinse with distilled water. Dab dry with a kimtech wipe and return the probe to the storage solution.
>If the substance is reluctant to be rinsed from the probe, run the probe under warm sink water. **Be sure to rinse with distilled water afterwards**. It is better to rinse more aggressively with sink water than to rub the probe clean with a kimtech wipe.

## Calibration
Calibration procedure varies greatly by model, so be sure to reference the manual for precise directions. The following is a general calibration procedure.

### Step 1
Press &quot;CAL&quot; button on the device to enter calibration mode.

### Step 2
Remove the probe from the storage solution, rinse and dry the probe as you would to test a product.

### Step 3
The device display should read the value of a target buffer solution (e.g. 7.01). Place the probe into directed buffer solution.

### Step 4
The device will calibrate to that buffer solution and it will indicate when it is ready to move on to the next solution. At that time repeat **Step 2** and **Step 3**.

### Step 5
For a 2 point calibration using the 4.01 and 7.01 buffer solutions, after both buffers have been used, the calibration is completed and the probe can be returned to the storage solution.

## Maintenance
Maintenance of the pH probe involves keeping the probe clean and hydrated. If the probe is left dry for extended periods of time, it may be irreversibly damaged.

Buffer solutions and storage solutions should be changed on a weekly basis minimum and more frequently if they become soiled.

## Purpose
The purpose of the Brookfield viscometer is to test the viscosity of drinkable finished products.


## Terms/Definitions
**Brookfield Viscometer:** A device consisting of a spindle suspended from a rotating spring. The spindle is submerged in the sample and a motor rotates the spring and thus the spindle within the sample. The friction between the surface of the spindle and the sample fluid puts tension on the spring. The tension is measured by the device and reports a quantitative value representing the fluid viscosity of the sample. The device displays the average cP of completed full rotation of the spindle. The value will only be displayed after 3 full rotations.

**Centipoise(cP):** A unit of dynamic viscosity in the centimeter-gram-second system of units equal to one one-hundredth of a poise. The viscosity of water at 70 F is 1 centipoise.

**Speed:** The speed at which the motor rotates the spindle. The speed setting will vary based upon the spindle in use and the viscosity of the product.

**Torque:** The percentage value on the device screen display between the speed(##RPM) and the spindle(s##). The device uses the torque to calculate the final cP.

**Spindle:** The spindle is the portion of the device that is submerged into the sample. The entire body or disc of the spindle must be submerged for a proper reading. Most spindles will have a marker to show the level the sample should approach. The device must be set to the number associated with the specific spindle. This number should be etched onto the shaft of the spindle.

## Procedure
### Prep
Before using the brookfield viscometer, you must ensure that the base is secure on a sturdy surface and the device is securely mounted to the support shaft. The height can be adjusted by turning the knob adjacent to the shaft, but releasing the knob after a short movement should not result in the unit sliding freely down the shaft.

After the unit is secure, the entire head can be rotated to broadly level the device. Refer to the level indicator bubble to level the device as much as possible. If needed, adjust the feet of the mount to fine tune the orientation of the device so that the bubble is exactly in the middle of the indicator.

Determine the spindle needed for the product to be tested. Attach the spindle to the device by gently lifting the threaded mount up into the device body and thread the spindle onto the mount while maintaining a constant lift. It is important to lift the mount while attach the spindle because doing so disengages the mount from the spring preventing you from damaging the integrity of the spring while attaching the spindle. 
#### **Manually turning the spindle while the spring is engaged will permanently damage the spring and readings will no longer be accurate.**

If a spindle guard is to be used (recommended for products less viscous products) gently slide the guard over the secured spindle and attach the guard to guard mounting bracket.

| Product | Spindle | Speed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Milk-type | s00 | 13RPM |
| kefir-type | s05 | ~30RPM |

### Step 1
After the correct spindle and spindle guard if applicable are securely in place, pour the sample fluid into a container that is tall enough to fully submerge the spindle. If the guard is not being used and the spindle can fit safely inside the product bottle without touching the bottle itself, you may test the product directly in the finished product bottle.

### Step 2
With the device head lifted to an appropriate height, position the sample below the spindle. Carefully lower the spindle into the sample making sure to avoid contact between the spindle and the container walls. Make sure the spindle is submerged to the proper level for the particular spindle.

### Step 3
Confirm that the proper spindle is selected on the screen. Adjust the speed if needed. Press &guot;Motor&quot; to initiate the testing process. If the torque is below 10%, the speed must be adjusted up. If the value is reading cP &quot;EEEE&quot; you must decrease the speed.

### Step 4
Allow the unit to run until the cP value no longer makes any significant changes. Press the &quot;Motor&quot; button to stop the testing process. Record the value of cP on the appropriate form.

### Step 5
Using the knob adjacent to the support shaft, lift the spindle out of the sample being careful not to contact the container with the spindle. Replace the sample container with a larger empty container and spray the spindle thoroughly with distilled water to rinse away any product.

## Calibration
Unfortunately, there is no calibration that can be done by the user. However, you can check the accuracy of the device by performing a test on room temperature water(70&deg;F) which should result in a reading of 1 cP.

## Maintenance
### Cleaning
All spindles and spindle guards can be cleaned while removed from the device using warm water and a gentle dish soap. Do not use abrasive scrubs or sponges to clean the spindles. If the surface of the spindle is scuffed or chipped the integrity of the test is compromised.
